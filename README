    README for Perl module UNIVERSAL::require

This module lets you require other modules where the module
name is in a variable, something you can't do with the 'require' built-in.

You can read a nicely formatted version of the documentation for
this module online:

    https://metacpan.org/pod/UNIVERSAL::require

You should be able to install this using your usual method for installing
modules from CPAN. If you don't have a usual method yet, have a look at:

This module was written by Michael G Schwern.
It is now being maintained by Neil Bowers <neilb@cpan.org>
